Understanding gene function can be a complex and challenging task, but it is an important area of research that is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological systems and for developing new treatments for diseases. One reason is the complexity of biological systems, as gene function often involves multiple mechanisms and pathways that can be difficult to understand. Another reason is the lack of a complete understanding of gene function, as our understanding is constantly evolving as new research is conducted and discoveries are made. It can be difficult to keep up with the latest findings and understand how they fit together. Additionally, understanding gene function often requires a foundation in biology and related fields. Finally, research articles on gene function are often written in specialized language that can be difficult for non-experts to understand, which can make it challenging to extract information about gene function from research articles. We propose PATHAK, a new method to link genes with the potential function using sentence-level embedding of scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model. Our approach involves using a pre-trained Transformer language model of a large dataset of scientific documents and using the resulting sentence embeddings to identify relationships between genes and their potential GO term definition. Our method, called PATHAK, is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of scientific domains, and we believe it has the potential to advance our understanding of gene function and facilitate the discovery of new treatments for diseases. Our method was applied to a large dataset of papers,
198
approximately 5,000, focusing on Arabidopsis thaliana and the genes related to this plant species. This is a significant development and adds to our understanding of the complex mechanisms at work within Arabidopsis thaliana and similar plant species. We are eager to continue exploring the potential applications of our method and hope to make further discoveries in the future.
